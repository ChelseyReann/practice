//Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
//Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
//Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elemnts which are not equla to val. the remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
//return k
